# Quantom Comuputing

On this page I collect all the information on what a quantom computer is, how it works and what problems it can solve.

## History

### [The Computer as a Physical System: A Microscopic Quantum Mechanical Hamiltonian Model of Computers as Represented by Turing Machines ](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01011339.pdf) ###

In this paper describes a hamilitonian model that describe computations from Turing machines. Since any digital computer
can be replaced by a Turing machine of equal or greater computing power, this leads to the conclusion, that any computation can in theory be carried out by a quantom mechanical hamilitonian.
